Notes to self:

Custom CSS in my_resume.css, mostly to do with tweaking the sidebar and the margins (still want to work on shrinking the right margin a bit).

Default output is HTML, but can use pagedown::chrome_print() for PDF version, which is currently saved as a static file in the website respoitory.
